ixp_pdata

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
  #include <ixp.h>
  
  void ixp_pdata(IxpMsg *msg, char **data, uint len);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Packs or unpacks a raw character buffer of size IlenR.

.P
If ImsgR\->mode is MsgPack, buffer pointed to by IdataR is
packed into the buffer at ImsgR\->pos. If ImsgR\->mode is
MsgUnpack, the address pointed to by IsR is loaded with a
malloc(3) allocated buffer with the contents of the buffer at
ImsgR\->pos.  In either case, ImsgR\->pos is advanced by the
number of bytes read or written. If the action would advance
ImsgR\->pos beyond ImsgR\->end, ImsgR\->pos is still advanced
but no other action is taken.
