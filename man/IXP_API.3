.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
IXP_API contains the current libixp API revision number.

.P
IXP_NEEDAPI, if defined before ixp.h is included, directs the
header to present an older version of the libixp API. This allows
code written for older versions of libixp to compile against
newer versions without modification. It does not, however, ensure
that it will link against a different version of libixp than the
ixp.h header belongs to.

.P
IXP_MAXAPI, if defined before ixp.h is included, prevents code
from compiling with a newer version of libixp than specified.

.P
When inserted into any function, IXP_ASSERT_VERSION ensures that
the resulting object will fail to link link against any version
of libixp with a different API version than it was compiled
against.
