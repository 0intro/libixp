.SH NAME
.P
ixp_pstrings

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
  #include <ixp.h>
  
  void ixp_pstrings(IxpMsg *msg, uint16_t *num, char *strings\fI[]\fR, uint max);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Packs or unpacks an array of UTF\-8 encoded strings. The packed
representation consists of a 16\-bit element count followed by
an array of strings as packed by \fBixp_pstring(3)\fR. The unpacked
representation is an array of nul\-terminated character arrays.

.P
If ImsgR\->mode is MsgPack, I*numR strings in the array
pointed to by IstringsR are packed into the buffer at
ImsgR\->pos. If ImsgR\->mode is MsgUnpack, I*numR is loaded
with the number of strings unpacked, the array at
I*stringsR is loaded with pointers to the unpacked strings,
and I(*strings)\fI[0]\fRR must be freed by the user. In either
case, ImsgR\->pos is advanced by the number of bytes read or
written. If the action would advance ImsgR\->pos beyond
ImsgR\->end, ImsgR\->pos is still advanced, but no other
action is taken. If I*numR is greater than ImaxR,
ImsgR\->pos is set beyond ImsgR\->end and no other action is
taken.
