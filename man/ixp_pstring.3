ixp_pstring

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
  #include <ixp.h>
  
  void ixp_pstring(IxpMsg *msg, char **s);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Packs or unpacks a UTF\-8 encoded string. The packed
representation of the string consists of a 16\-bit unsigned
integer followed by the contents of the string. The unpacked
representation is a nul\-terminated character array.

.P
If ImsgR\->mode is MsgPack, the string pointed to by IsR is
packed into the buffer at ImsgR\->pos. If ImsgR\->mode is
MsgUnpack, the address pointed to by IsR is loaded with a
malloc(3) allocated, nul\-terminated representation of the
string packed at ImsgR\->pos. In either case, ImsgR\->pos is
advanced by the number of bytes read or written. If the
action would advance ImsgR\->pos beyond ImsgR\->end,
ImsgR\->pos is still advanced but no other action is taken.
