.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
.B ixpc
is a client to access a 9P file server from the command line or from shell
scripts. It can be used to configure
.BR wmii (1).
.SS Options
.TP
.BI \-a " address"
Lets you specify the address to which
.B ixpc
will establish a connection. If this option is not supplied, and the
environment variable IXP_ADDRESS is set,
.B ixpc
will use this value as its address. Currently, the address can only be a
unix socket file or a tcp socket. The syntax for
.I address
is taken (along with many other profound ideas) from the Plan 9 operating
system and has the form
.BR unix!/path/to/socket 
for unix socket files, and
.BR tcp!hostname!port
for tcp sockets.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints version information to stdout, then exits.
.TP
The syntax of the actions is as follows:
.TP
.B write
Writes the supplied data from the standard input to
.IR file,
overwriting any previous data.  The data to be written is arbitrary
and only gains meaning (and restrictions) when it is interpreted by
.BR wmiiwm (1).
See
.B EXAMPLES
below.
.TP
.B xwrite
The same as write, but the data is taken from subsequent arguments,
rather than the standard input.
.TP
.B create
Creates file or directory. If the file exists,
nothing is done.
.TP
.B ls
Lists files and directories.
.TP
.B read
Reads file or directory contents.
.TP
.B remove
Removes file or directory tree.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
IXP_ADDRESS
See above.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B ixpc ls /
This prints the root directory of the wmii filesystem, if IXP_ADDRESS is set
to the address of wmii. For more information about the contents of this
filesystem, see
.BR wmiiwm (1).
.TP
.B ixpc xwrite /ctl quit
Write 'quit' to the main control file of the wmii filesystem, effectively
leaving wmii.
.TP
.B ixpc write /keys \< keys.txt
Replace the contents of
.I /keys
with the contents of
.I keys.txt
